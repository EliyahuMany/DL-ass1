1. We can get better accuracies by using backpropagation algorithms, backpropagation algorithms is king of learning technique.

2. After switching from letter-bigrams to letter-unigrams, the best for the log-linear model was 60% and for the MLP model was 85%.

3. After we tried to verify the MLP learning the XOR problem, we had to do at least 100 iterations to keep on stability.
